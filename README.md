# OnTheMap
## Udacity.com ios Nanodegree project 3
Swift Language Version: Swift 5<br/>
Xcode Version: 11.3.1

## Application Description
OnTheMap is an application that allows a user to see information(location, URL link) posted by other Udacity.com students. The map will contain pins that show the locations where other students have reported studying. By tapping on the pin on the map, users can see a URL for which the student finds interesting and wants to share. The user will be able to add their own data of location by posting a string that can be geocoded to a specific location, and a URL.

## From this project, I have learned to:
Access networked data using Appleâ€™s URL loading framework<br/>
Authenticate a user using over a network connection<br/>
Create user interfaces that are responsive, and communicate network activity<br/>
Use Core Location and the MapKit framework to display annotated pins on a map
